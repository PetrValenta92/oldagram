## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS pseudoclasses
- Flexbox
- BEM

### What I learned

On this project, I mainly practiced my new knowledge of semantic HTML and CSS skills, I have learned and practiced how to work with BEM and practiced my work with Figma template.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to add some JavaScript. I would like to add events for click on heart icon and double-click on post picture. Both events will change the heart icon's design and add "+1" to post's likes. Another double/click will undo the action (and add "-1" to likes). Also I would like to make the page more dinamic. Post will be rendered randomly from the "post database". Other posts of "Old VIP" profiles will be added.
